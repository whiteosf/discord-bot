Subtract     Takes in two arguments and retuns their difference.
Multiply     Takes in two arguments and returns their product.

            coefficients of the polynomial with account on those, which are 0s. 
            The last argument will be a value of x you are willing to solve for.
Sqrt Simplifier     Takes in radicand as argument and returns algebraicaly simplified square root.
